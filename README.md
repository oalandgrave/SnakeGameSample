# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Angular.

## Features

- The snake moves in the direction specified by the arrow keys.
- The snake can go through the wall and appear on the opposite side.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself.
- The score increases by one each time the snake eats an apple.
- The high score is stored in local storage and displayed on the game screen.
